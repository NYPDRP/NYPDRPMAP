Changelog
=========


v2.2.11 (06-04-2018)
--------------------

Fix
~~~
- Fixed update alerts. [Jordan Dalton]

  Update alerts were still using the old alert system. Now it uses the new one.


v2.2.10 (06-04-2018)
--------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update to v2.2.10. [Jordan Dalton]

Fix
~~~
- Fixed blip icons not working on other servers. [Jordan Dalton]

  When selecting another server, the URL for the blip icons would change to `/server?test+server/images/icons` which, is wrong.


v2.2.9 (06-04-2018)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Add blip controls. [Jordan Dalton]

  Users can now toggle on/off the blips they want.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update to v2.2.9. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update favicon. [Jordan Dalton]

  Favicon is now a nicer image that make sense. Taken from: https://www.freefavicon.com/freefavicons/objects/iconinfo/map-pin-152-195874.html
- Update alert system. [Jordan Dalton]

  Alerts now use a library instead of the custom-built one. It's much better and smoother :P


v2.2.8 (04-03-2018)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Added overlays. [Jordan Dalton]

  Overlays, Overlays, Overlays!

  So, the map images now have a street overlay folder that is, well, overlayed onto the over images. Woo. So, now you don't need to send the street names with the player data.. Well, if you still want that you can.

  Just make sure to download the latest image release, and pop them into your map folder.
- Add dynamic blip controls. [Jordan Dalton]

  Blip controls are now created and popped into the right div when the webapp is navigated to.

  Still need to implement the actual behaviour.
- Add version to title. [Jordan Dalton]

  The webapp now displays the current version next to it's name. E.g. "Live Map v2.2.7"
- Add temporary favicon. [Jordan Dalton]

  Added a temp favicon for the webpage.
- Add dynamic blip CSS. [Jordan Dalton]

  Blip images for use in HTML is dynamically created in the generateBlipShit function in "markers.js". Since there's a load of blips, I felt dynamically creating them would be better than sitting down for two hours and manually putting them in. It doesn't take into account the other marker types (yet).

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update to latest development. [Jordan Dalton]

  I can't remember what I changed but, something has so...
- Update dropdown CSS. [Jordan Dalton]

  Dropdowns now comply with the dark theme
- Update sidebar to be more mobile friendly. [Jordan Dalton]

  Before the sidebar wasn't very nice on smaller devices such as mobiles. This change should fix this. This also means that the map takes up the full webpage and users need to click the "Hide/Show Controls" button before they can see the controls.
- Update alerts. [Jordan Dalton]

  Alerts can now be scrolled though

Fix
~~~
- Fixed map background. [Jordan Dalton]

  Background for the map now changed with the map instead of staying the same colour.
- Fixed alert holder width. [Jordan Dalton]

  The new alert holder would cut off alerts on smaller screens. Should be fixed now.

-------------------

New
~~~
- Add server selection. [Jordan Dalton]

  Users can now select a server to view, if you have multiple servers to show.

  I will update the readme to reflect these changes but, the easiest way to get this working is to add a empty array to the servers file with a name of your choice.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Update changelog. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update to v2.2.7. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update readme. [Jordan Dalton]
- Update navbar. [Jordan Dalton]

  Navbar now has stuff in it... Well, it _will_ do when I add them.
- Update style. [Jordan Dalton]

  Bootstrap 4 was released so, I thought I'd give it a try. With this, I've had to update the style of the interface.

  The interface is now fully dark. This means the navigation elements (mainly the sidebar and navbar) is now dark.

  Labels have changed... Well, bootstrap have renamed them to "badges" so, I've been forced to call them the same.

  I've re-done the sidebar so, it no longer uses lists. It's just plain 'ol links.

  Alerts are now just a solid color instead of a gradient.. Ew, who likes gradients anyways?

Fix
~~~
- Fixed socket label not using bootstrap 4. [Jordan Dalton]

  Socket label was updated to "badge" as per the new bootstrap system.

- Update update system. [Jordan Dalton]

  Update system now uses the new alert system. I think it looks nicer.
- Change console.debug to console.log. [Jordan Dalton]

  debug doesn't seem to want to work for me so, I've reverted them to logs.

-------------------

New

Fix
~~~
- Fixed minifying issues. [Jordan Dalton]

  Setting "$debug" to false  now correctly minifies the JS code. Before, it would minify it but syntax errors (missing semicolons) would cause the code to not execute.
  I've also added final_newline to the editor config (I can't remember where but, I heard it's better to have them).
- Fixed minifying issues. [Jordan Dalton]

  There was some issues when using the minifier ($debug = false). They were caused by missing semicolons (don't ask). So, now minifying should work like a charm.

  This fixes varrious stuff so that it can work with v2.1.1 of live_map

- Dynamically generated MarkerTypes. [Jordan Dalton]

  Holy fuck.. This took a lot of manual labour just to type out the blips the map can use :(

  Anyways, the MarkerTypes should now be generated when the page is loaded, saves on hardcoding each and every blip (there's hundereds) plus, it should allow for people to easily change the sprite sheet if they want.
